This section of the Cross-Industry PM Playbook captures how I’ve led not only through formal roles or projects, but also through curating inclusive, insight-driven experiences across industries. This includes Fortune 500 business resource groups, nonprofit and museum education programs, STEAM-integrated youth initiatives, and career development events in advisory roles. Curation here is not a sidebar — it is a **core innovation and leadership competency**.

## 🧬 Innovative DNA in Action

Curation is an expression of my Innovator’s DNA — the ability to connect dots across disciplines, sense emerging needs, and design high-impact moments that reflect both organizational goals and individual growth. It blends insight, empathy, and strategic planning with cross-functional fluency.

My curatorial work has included:
- ✳️ Business Resource Groups (BRGs): As an individual contributor, curated and led events that advanced equity and visibility, influencing without authority.
- 🏛️ Museum and Informal Education: As a VP of Education & Programs, led public programs, family days, and interdisciplinary learning labs centered on accessibility, STEAM, and cultural fluency.
- 🌱 Nonprofit Learning Ecosystems: Designed after-school, school-based, and public education events aligned with learning standards and community engagement.
- 🎓 NAF Academy Advisory Board Chair: Curated and facilitated career fairs and industry exposure programs in collaboration with public high schools and local employers.
-  J Rêve International LLC: STEAM+ Arts Integration Conference Co-Chair and Contributing Author to STEAM+ Arts Integration Anthology: Insights and Practical Applications companion book 
- 📚 This very playbook and [Innovation Reading List](https://github.com/AliciaMMorgan/cross-industry-pm-playbook/blob/main/Innovation_Leadership_Reading_List.md:) is a curatorial act of synthesis and empowerment.

## 🧠 Curation as Strategic Competency

Curating isn’t just organizing — it’s insight-based sensemaking. It requires:
- Seeing patterns and gaps in audience needs  
- Translating abstract goals into meaningful experiences  
- Creating environments where people feel included, seen, and activated  
- Exercising influence without direct authority  

It’s also a visible expression of my leadership when I wasn’t “in charge,” and how I’ve built trust across functions, communities, and disciplines.

## 🔧 Frameworks That Shape My Curatorial Practice

- **Learning Styles & Reflective Practice**:  
  Recognizing diverse learning preferences (visual, auditory, reading/writing, kinesthetic) strengthens both communication and knowledge transfer. Frameworks like Bloom’s Taxonomy help design experiences for deeper engagement and reflective growth.

- **Inclusive Design & Accessibility**:  
  Events and programs I curate consider visual accessibility (contrast, layout), language clarity, neurodiversity, and assistive technologies — creating equitable participation across user needs.

- **Psychological Safety for Innovation & Inclusion**:  
  Rooted in research by Dr. Amy Edmondson, psychological safety enables team learning, risk-taking, and honest feedback. I curate experiences that make space for divergent thinking, respect dissent, and encourage inclusive contributions.

- **Generational Learning & Digital Natives**:  
  Programs are informed by how Gen Z and digital-native learners engage — valuing interactive, impact-driven messaging and culturally relevant framing.

- **Influence as Pull, Not Push**:  
  Many of my curatorial contributions were executed from positions without formal authority. Understanding strategic communication and social capital allowed me to build coalitions and shape outcomes through trust and alignment.

## 🧩 Lessons Learned Beyond the Agenda

Curation taught me:
- Leadership often happens through design, not just decision-making.
- People remember how they **felt** in an experience more than what was said.
- Cross-functional fluency means knowing how to **listen across boundaries**.
- Inclusion isn’t an afterthought — it’s in the design itself.
- Influence is earned through empathy, clarity, and trust.

## 💡 Curation as Thought-Pilot, Not Just Program Lead

Curating across sectors has made me a stronger systems thinker, storyteller, and integrator. It’s taught me to lead by **setting tone and framing possibilities**, not just managing logistics. I curate with the mindset of a **thought pilot** — charting new paths, not just repeating past agendas.

## 🔁 Feedback & Reflective Assessment

### 360° Reach Personal Brand Assessment

This 360° brand assessment provides insights into how colleagues and collaborators perceive my professional presence, leadership style, and overall impact. It is rooted in qualitative feedback from peers, supervisors, and mentees.

Top attributes identified include:
- 🧭 Judge – clarity, discernment, and integrity  
- 🧠 Expert – knowledge depth and structured thinking  
- 🔥 Muse – creativity, tone-setting, and energy  
- 💡 Self-Starter – ownership and vision  
- 🤝 Philanthropist – people-centered design and impact  

These responses highlight my ability to connect strategy to execution, empower others, and create environments of trust, vision, and shared success.

### Business Chemistry Profile (Deloitte)

**Business Chemistry** is a workplace personality framework developed by **Deloitte** that helps teams understand diverse work styles, motivations, and collaboration dynamics. It identifies four types:  
- **Driver** – Focused, goal-oriented, and logical  
- **Guardian** – Detail-oriented, pragmatic, and dependable  
- **Integrator** – Empathetic, relationship-driven, and consensus-seeking  
- **Pioneer** – Creative, spontaneous, and risk-tolerant  

I identify primarily as a **Driver** and **Guardian**, which explains why I thrive in fast-paced, results-driven environments while anchoring my work in structure, quality, and long-term relationship-building. This dual style deeply informs how I curate and lead across disciplines.
