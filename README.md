👋 **Welcome**

This playbook grew out of my journey from traditional PM work in technical environments to innovation leadership across nonprofits, education, and enterprise organizations. In this context, **PM** includes both structured project execution and strategic program leadership, roles often adjacent to product and operations management. It’s designed to help project managers, program leaders, innovation leaders, and cross-functional teams build from structure into adaptive agility, without losing clarity or execution discipline.

>🔍 A cross-industry PM requires fluency in both explicit knowledge (formal methods, strategic frameworks) and tacit knowledge — the kind learned through lived experience, timing, communication, and decision-making across complex, real-world settings. This playbook includes both, grounded in a lived cross-sector journey, mapped out in the companion [Cross-Industry PM Career Roadmap](https://github.com/users/AliciaMMorgan/projects/2/views/1).

> This open-source playbook is hosted on GitHub and serves as a career-spanning archive — part roadmap, part reflection — capturing the principles, pivots, and practical tools behind cross-industry leadership.

📇 **About Me**

I'm Alicia M. Morgan—a 15+ years **award-winning** PMP-certified project/program strategist with a foundation in aerospace and industrial engineering. I began my career leading technical execution, lean manufacturing, and capital improvement projects in regulated, high-stakes environments. Over time, I transitioned into the nonprofit and education sectors, bringing structured thinking into more ambiguous spaces while expanding my focus on innovation, digital transformation, and strategic program design.

### 🧠What Guides My Thinking: Business Chemistry®

Based on research by Deloitte, Business Chemistry is a framework designed to help teams collaborate more effectively by recognizing different working styles. The four types—Driver, Guardian, Pioneer, and Integrator—each offer distinct strengths in leadership, innovation, and execution.

According to Deloitte’s Business Chemistry®, I am a primary Driver and secondary Guardian. This unique pairing shapes how I lead transformation across traditional and emerging environments:

- 🚗 As a **Driver**, I’m structured, outcome-oriented, and energized by complex service. I cut through ambiguity and deliver results. I also bring a unique, empathic leadership style, allowing me to lead with both engineering precision and emotional intelligence—ideal for bridging innovation with accountability.
- 🛡️ As a **Guardian**, I value precision, risk-awareness, and structure—essential traits for navigating regulated, high-stakes, or legacy systems. I’m methodical, dependable, and lead with care.
     What sets me apart from many Guardians is a strong networking orientation, a deep appreciation for diverse skill sets, and the ability to infuse creative thinking, key to building trust across silos and driving collaboration in complex environments.

🔄 In contrast, Pioneers thrive on brainstorming and rapid ideation, while Integrators focus on team cohesion and emotional insight. I collaborate effectively by bringing structure to vision and momentum to consensus.


🎯 **Why it matters**: This Driver–Guardian combo allows me to align people, systems, and innovation. Whether building out new programs or scaling proven solutions, I apply the discipline of a PMP, the logic of an engineer, and the curiosity of an innovator.
